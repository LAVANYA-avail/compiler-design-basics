#This program aims to finds and prints keywords,identifiers,string literals and operators. It uses token recognisation and character by character logic. The program asks the user to enter code line by line asnd saves it in input.txt the typing END stops the input. Analyzer reads the input.txt it skips whitespaces and checks if a word is a keyword,identifier or number and also detects and prints operators. I learned how lexical analysis is used. It breaks code into tokens and i also learned how string processing works in c.
